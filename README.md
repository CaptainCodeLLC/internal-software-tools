### Login/Registration Authentication built off of OKTA Authentication and Password reset system

Here's the guide:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-and-understand-a-simple-nodejs-website-with-user-authentication

#### Usage (What this repo is for):

This boilerplate code can be used as a starting point for a full stack application where we would want to integrate authentication in a quick and painless manner.

For every new application the requires a registration and login functionality, we can clone this repo and create a new application in Okta, and create a new keys.js file inside the login-app

Eventually we will build out an application that has various views in React and the full-flegded backend in Node.js

#### Installation:

After cloning,

```cd login-app```

and install all the dependencies: 

```npm install```

Then run

```npm start```

and go to:

```http://localhost:3000``` on your browser
